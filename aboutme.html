      <h2 class="hero_header">MY <span class="light">STORY</span></h2>
      <p class="tagline">A less than brief summary&nbsp;</p>
    </section>
    <p class="text_column2">I began coding as early as 9 years old, managing to convince my parents to buy me a $100 "C++ for Dummies" book, and immediately I knew programming was what I wanted to do. &nbsp;I continued to explore this as time went on and I began scripting for video games I was playing, starting with C# scripting for Tribes 2. &nbsp;I moved on to writing with VBScript for a moderation bot on Starcraft and Warcraft 3, but I was still only performing basic string manipulation and data retrieval. &nbsp;I then worked for some time with JASS, the coding language for Warcraft 3's custom map engine, and created a few unique ideas - for example, a ping pong map with simulated physics, or a base-72 encryption algorithm for 'saving' data securely.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Around this time I began working through Advanced Placement courses in high school; I took as many programming and IT related classes as I could, including Oracle database, Java programming, and began work on a Cisco certification. &nbsp;In the Java course, I built a 'game' from the ground up that involved a turret shooting rabbits who were trying to steal your carrots. &nbsp;Okay, it wasn't a turret, it was a monkey ... and it wasn't shooting, it was flinging feces - but what do you expect from a high schooler. &nbsp;I cleared Calculus 2 before completing high school and moved on to a community college for financial reasons. &nbsp;I worked through my courses and earned an Associate's degree, snagging a few extra programming courses along the way - Python, C++, more Java, and Linear Algebra (which should definitely count as a programming course)</p>
    <p class="text_column2">I moved on to University at Appalachian State. &nbsp;School had begun to take its toll and I had not managed to work up any new projects in the meantime, but I finished many more programming courses - Software Engineering, Database, Computer Science Theory, Computer Systems, Data Structures, and advanced Java. </p>
    <p class="text_column">In the last semester of my final year, I ran into personal problems and could not keep up my attendance. &nbsp;I decided that my best course of action would be to take a short break and return the next semester - but unfortunately, it was too late to withdraw from my classes. &nbsp;Since the school offered a certain amount of 'replacement' grades, I felt it was best to take the F's in each course and replace them next semester.</p>
    <p class="text_column2">Turns out, financial aid frowns upon failing every course in a semester. &nbsp;Without financial aid I couldn't afford to return, and never received a bachelor's degree. </p>
    
    <p class="text_column">From here I began work in my current occupation, remote technical support. &nbsp;I quickly moved to my preferred third shift, where I was the only employee on shift, and was responsible for handling any and all issues myself. &nbsp;After a bit over two years I was moved to a Level 2 management position, overseeing all employees during second shift - but most importantly, I became the person to solve any problems nobody else could solve. &nbsp;I wrote my own interface, "<a href="/sc3" class="link">Support Center 3</a>", to increase productivity and as a personal challenge. &nbsp;I wrote firewall rules, and scripts for Mikrotik routers that alerted us of problems, and accomplished things we could not do previously - such as limiting bandwidth in a way that scales with the number of users and how much data they're using. &nbsp;I also automated many programming processes with these scripts, saving signficant amounts of time. </p>
    <p class="text_column2">I was handed other projects I was less interested in and handled them appropriately, picking up skills with Active Directory, SQL, hardware troubleshooting and security. &nbsp;I was customer facing and the go-to person for writing e-mails, involving me directly with any problems involving anyone important as a client - unfortunately, because of this I never learned how to write succinctly (I'm sure you haven't noticed), but I became very good at handling customers and explaining things, verbose as I might be.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column shaded addBottomBorder">This is where I stand at the moment - I am an IT support manager with a heavy programming background but only an Associate's degree, seeking to get out of the IT field and into programming. &nbsp;I am pushing my current company to employ me as a programmer - and as a result, I'm being given small programming projects - but this company is very small and cannot afford to pay fair wages for a full time programmer. &nbsp;With this website, I'm simply hoping to show off that even though I do not have a Bachelor's degree, I am more capable than many programmers who do. </p>
